A building block that shows how to handle a user input with DTMF. The
user enters an option on the keypad and the selected option is acknowledged
via a text-to-speech message.

## Example

## Try it out

Call your Nexmo Number. When the call is answered you will hear
a menu. Press `1` on the keypad and press the `#` key. You will then hear
a text-to-speech message acknowledging your selected option.
