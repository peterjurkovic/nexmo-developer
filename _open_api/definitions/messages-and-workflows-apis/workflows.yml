  title: Workflows API
  description: 'The Workflows API enables the developer to specify a multiple message workflow. A workflow follows a template. The first one we are adding is the failover template. The failover template instructs the messaging API to first send a message to the specified channel. If that message fails immediately or if the condition_status is not reached within the given time period the next message is sent. The developer will also recieve status webhooks from the messages resource for each delivery and read event. This API is currently in Developer Preview and you will need to [request access](https://www.nexmo.com/products/messages) to use it.'

The final message in the failover is delivered. If the message Errors on the last step we will send the final callback. Please note GET is not currently supported. You will notice we have an href to a resource in some of the callbacks. These will fail to load but we wanted to maintain the same structure so that we can seamlessly integrate GET later.
