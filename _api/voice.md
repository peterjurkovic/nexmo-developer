# Voice API reference

## Calls

You use the following requests to create, terminate, record and retrieve information about your calls:

###  Create an outbound call

[POST] `https://api.nexmo.com/v1/calls`

This request contains:

* A [Base URL](#base-url)
* [Payload](#payload)
* [JWT](#generating-a-jwt)

Information about the call is sent to you in the:

* [Response](#response) - parameters sent synchronously when the call starts.
* [Webhook](#webhook) - parameters sent asynchronously when the status changes

#### Base URL

All requests to create a call must contain:

* `https://api.nexmo.com/v1/calls`

#### Payload

The payload to create a new call looks like:

## Security and authentication

Each call you make to this API must have:

* [Security](#security)
* [Encoding](#encode)

### Encoding

You submit all requests with a [POST] or [GET] call using UTF-8 encoding and URL encoded values. The expected `Content-Type` for [POST] is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. For calls to a JSON endpoint, we also support:

* `application/json`
* `application/jsonrequest`
* `application/x-javascript`
* `text/json`
* `text/javascript`
* `text/x-javascript`
* `text/x-json` when posting parameters as a JSON object.

## Generating a JWT

The Nexmo Voice API uses JWTs to authenticate calls from your application. You generate a JWT by encrypting a JSON object containing the ID and private key of your application plus the current time. You add your JWT to the header in your requests to Nexmo API. The JWT authenticates your requests and tells Nexmo which application you are using.

A JWT consists of a header, a payload and a signature in the structure xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz. For more information, see  <https://jwt.io/introduction/> and the [JWT reference ](/concepts/guides/applications#reference).

The following code examples show how to generate a JWT token:

```tabbed_examples
source: _examples/api/voice/jwt
```

When you use JWTs for authentication, you must still follow [Security](#security) and [Encoding](#encode).

## `status` values

The table below lists the possible values for the status of a call as returned by a number of Voice API endpoints.

Value | Description
-- | --
`started` | Platform has started the call.
`ringing` | The user's handset is ringing.
`answered` | The user has answered your call.
`machine` | Platform detected an answering machine.
`human` | Platform detected human answering the call.
`completed` | Platform has terminated this call.
`timeout` | Your user did not answer your call within `ringing_timer` seconds.
`failed` | The call failed to complete
`rejected` | The call was rejected
`cancelled` | The call was not answered
`busy` | The number being dialled was on another call

When a Call enters a state of `timeout`, `failed`, `rejected`, `cancelled` or `busy` the `event_url` webhook endpoint can optionally return an NCCO to override the current NCCO. See [Connect with fallback NCCO](/voice/guides/ncco-reference#connect_fallback).


## Errors

The following HTTP codes are supported:

Code | Description
-- | --
`200` | Success
`201` | Resource created
`204` | No content
`401` | Unauthorized
`404` | Not found
`429` | Rate limited
`500` | Nexmo server error

The error format is standardized to the `4xx`/`5xx` range with a code and a human readable explanation. For example, for an authentication failure.

```json
{
  "type": "TYPE",
  "error_title":"TITLE",
  "invalid_parameters":{
    "type":"Is required."
  }
}
```
